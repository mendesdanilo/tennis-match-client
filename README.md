Hi (:

Tennis-match-client is the frontend of my final project at Ironhack Lisbon. 

First of all, the project would not have existed without the help of professor Miguel and assistant professor Stefano. 

TennisMatch's original idea is to connect tennis players recruiters to college tennis coaches. We used ReactJS, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. The theme is inspired on videogames because although the recruiting and matching processes can be challanging, they could be fun. Or it should. 

The user card and buttons were used from npm-tinder-card and material-ui, respectively.
