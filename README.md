<h1>Tennis-Match-Client</h1>

<h2>Intro</h2>

Welcome (:

Tennis-match-client is the frontend part of my final project at Ironhack Lisbon. 

Tennis Match's original idea is to connect tennis players recruiters to college tennis coaches, similar to the tinder App. 

Since time was short I focused on the main MVP functionalities such as the login/sign up verification, profile update, picture upload and the main features which are liking, disliking and matching with other users. 

I plan to continuing working on this project in order to enhance the user experience and the user interface, as well as implement new functionalities. 

<h2>Tech</h2>

HTML, CSS, ReactJS and JavaScript were used. The theme is inspired on videogames because although the recruiting and matching processes can be challanging, they could be fun. Or it should. 

The tinder card feature and buttons were used from npm-tinder-card and material-ui, respectively.

Of course, the project would not have existed without the help of professor Miguel and assistant professor Stefano.
